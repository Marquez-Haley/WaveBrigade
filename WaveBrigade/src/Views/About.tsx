                <p className="mb-4">WaveBrigade, inspired by Kahoot and TopHat, is a web-based platform with the purpose of deepening the learning experience by providing instructors with an interactive and user-friendly interface to create lesson plans for students. These lesson plans will be used and presented to students to collect real-time responses from them, utilizing the EmotiBit. In addition, this data will be illustrated through charts and graphs with consideration of their respective data type. WaveBrigade offers an environment where instructors can create virtual lobbies, create lesson plans, and introduce different types of media (such as videos and images) to enhance engagement amongst students. Students can join these lobbies with an access code, participate in the session, and capture their reactions to the media via the EmotiBit. Therefore, students can understand and reflect on the data captured to better understand the lesson material. </p>
                <p>WaveBrigadeâ€™s main functionality for instructors includes the creation of virtual lobbies, lesson plans, and the ability to manage a dynamic dashboard containing the media chosen, and the data collected from specific students. The host will be able to record the lobby as well as manage the data report by viewing or downloading it. A live chat functionality will be included for students and instructors to talk to each other when they need to. Our goal is not only to provide a platform for real-time interaction but to create a sense of community and resource-sharing among educators and students. </p>
